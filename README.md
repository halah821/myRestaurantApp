# myRestaurantApp
This is a Restaurant Reservation App. I found this App, It was deprecated and I was responsible for the renewal and bug fixing the app to make it work. It is written with clean code and well designed. It has java collections such as(ArrayList, Map), a ListAdapter, a DBHelper that has most common database operations. It also has IO files, Maps, HTTP, Threads, and JSON Parsing.
